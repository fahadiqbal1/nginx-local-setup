# Nginx Local Development

This repository allows one to easily set up new projects on an Nginx server. Used by me personally, if you happen to stumble upon this and want to make improvements, PLEASE let me know!

## Instructions

1. Install Nginx and PHP
2. Clone this repository to your development machine (I choose to clone it in my documents folder, but I suppose anywhere works)
3. Create a **sites.json** file and a **resources.json** file in the cloned directory
4. Rename the *config.php.sample* to **config.php** and fill in the appropriate information
5. Enjoy!
